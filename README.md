# Using Deep Learning to Hedge Rainbow Options

A thesis sent in partial fulfilment of the MSc 203 - Financial Markets of Paris Dauphine PSL University.

Written by Thibault Collin under the supervision of Prof. Thibaud Vienne and Prof. GaÃ«lle Le Fol.

The scope of this thesis is to further study the application of deep learning techniques in the context of hedging financial derivatives relying on several underlyings. This thesis demonstrates an ability of the algorithm to correctly replicate the hedging strategy for single-asset options under different dynamics, and illustrates some promising convergence for multi-asset derivatives under both regular and extreme market dynamics.

The code can be used and modified by anyone freely. Download the whole repository and run the main programs under your favorite Python IDE.

(the algorithm was partly inspired by https://github.com/YuMan-Tam/deep-hedging)
