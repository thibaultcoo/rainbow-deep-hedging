# Using Deep Learning to Hedge Rainbow Options

#### Written by Thibault Collin under the supervision of Prof. Thibaud Vienne and Prof. GaÃ«lle Le Fol.

*A thesis sent in partial fulfilment of the MSc 203 - Financial Markets of Paris Dauphine PSL University.*

The scope of this thesis is to further study the application of deep learning techniques in the context of **hedging financial derivatives relying on several underlyings**. This thesis demonstrates an ability of the algorithm to correctly replicate the hedging strategy for single-asset options under different dynamics, and illustrates some convergence for multi-asset derivatives under both regular and extreme market dynamics.

The complete paper is also available inside the repository (last overall update: April 23).

The code can be used and modified by anyone freely. Download the whole repository and run the main programs (named *mainVanilla* and *MainRainbow*) under your Python IDE.

Versions for the different libraries used (use latest version if not mentionned): Python 3.7 - Tensorflow 2.3.1

(the algorithm was partly inspired by https://github.com/YuMan-Tam/deep-hedging)
